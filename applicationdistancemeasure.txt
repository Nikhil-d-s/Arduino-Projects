The given project is a use case of ultrasonic sensor combined with Arduino Uno, a microcontroller which provides us an audible warning using buzzer while reversing a vehicle.
The buzzer starts beeping more and more intensely as the distance between the backside of the car and the obstacle behind it decreases from 20cm.
